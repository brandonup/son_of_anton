## Triage Lessons

- [2026-03-24] [kinetic] **Supabase free tier custom SMTP does not route `signInWithOtp` magic links.** Even with SMTP correctly configured (Resend, port 465, correct API key), magic link emails are silently dropped — only invite emails use custom SMTP. Workaround: Google OAuth or a Supabase Edge Function calling Resend API directly (see FounderPanel `supabase/functions/send-email/index.ts` for the pattern).

- [2026-03-19] [kinetic] **Test mocks that don't mirror the real library API give false confidence.** When a route 400s in production but tests pass, check the mock's export shape against the package's actual exports — especially after a major version bump. (pdf-parse v1 `default fn` → v2 `PDFParse class`)
- [2026-03-19] [kinetic] **`createServerClient` (SSR) vs `createAdminClient` (service role) is not interchangeable.** SSR client attaches user JWT → runs as `authenticated` → FORCE RLS applies → needs `app.workspace_id`. Admin client = no JWT, pure service_role, bypasses FORCE RLS. In Kinetic: API routes always use `createAdminClient` + explicit workspace_id filters.
- [2026-03-19] [kinetic] **When a DB function is missing from migrations, it's invisible to debugging.** `set_workspace_context` existed only in the dashboard; no error pointed to it being the cause. Always check if an RPC has a corresponding migration file before debugging its behavior.
